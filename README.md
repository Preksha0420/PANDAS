**Analyzing ‘Medicare Part D Drugs’ Spending Trends And Implications in relation to Diabetes**

Diabetes is a big problem for Medicare as it is a major prevalent chronic condition. According to an article by CDC, 61% of diabetes costs are for adults aged 65 or older, which is mainly paid by Medicare(CDC, 2020). Hence, understanding the financial aspects of diabetes-related medications is crucial for the stakeholders at Medicare. By examining the costs associated with diabetic medications, we aim to offer valuable information to Medicare stakeholders, contributing to informed decision-making and program effectiveness.

This project delves into Medicare Part D spending, specifically focusing on diabetic medications. The purpose of this analysis is to unveil spending patterns, identify outliers, and provide insights that can inform policy decisions, optimize resource allocation, and enhance care within the Medicare system.
