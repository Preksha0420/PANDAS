    "### Motivation behind the project\n",
    "We came across several articles that showed the impact of diabetes on the US healthcare system and its role within medicare. This motivated us to further dig deep into the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Diabetes is the most expensive chronic condition in our nation.(American Diabetes Association, 2018)\n",
    "- 1 out of every 4 dollar in US health care costs is spent on caring for people with diabetes.(American Diabetes Association, 2018)\n",
    "- 237 billion dollars is spent each year on direct medical costs and another 90 billion on reduced productivity.(American Diabetes Association, 2018)\n",
    "- 61% of diabetes costs are for adults aged 65 or older, which is mainly paid by Medicare.(American Diabetes Association, 2018)\n",
    "- Among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or older with type 2 diabetes, the estimated median costs associated with diabetes complications is 5,876 dollars per person each year.(Wang et al., 2022)\n",
    "- 48% to 64% of lifetime medical costs for a person with diabetes are for complications related to diabetes, such as heart disease and stroke.(Zhou et al., 2013)\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation behind this project to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare spending, particularly for a critical and growing area like diabetes treatment. By using data analysis, the project aims to contribute to better health outcomes, a more sustainable healtcare policy, and a more transparent and accountable healthcare system.\n",

    "As we see above, **97%** of the total spending is on the outliers and hence, this needs to be controlled and checked.\n",
    "Further looking into reasons behind this, as we can see the **top 5 companies** that are responsible for outlier spending patterns also have a monopoly in the drugs they create and hence charge exceptionally high amounts. This is an opportunity for new pharma companies or pharmaceutical companies finding an opportunity to dive into.\n",
    "Also, Medicare needs to negotiate its terms with these manufacturers in ways using policy reform, negotiating the prices, and leveraging the last customer base they have.\n",
    "Also, the companies that manufacture outlier drugs at lower costs and fall in the normal range, can be looked into for negotiation and providing them with better incentives.\n",

    "### Ethical considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ethical Standards within the project\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clearly documenting data sources and methodologies to **maintain\n",
    "transparency and trust**.\n",
    "- Ensuring patient data is **anonymized and protected**.\n",
    "- **Avoiding any bias** in the analysis that could impact policy decisions unfairly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ethical Issues out of hand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Potential biases in the original data collected by the Medicare Part D Program. This could be based on gender, region, race, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Risks:\n",
    "- The primary risk in our project is potential biases in the original dataset collected by Medicare Part D Program. These biases could be based on different factors such as gender, region, race, etc.\n",
    "- Such biases in the data can significantly affect the accuract and generalizability of our findings. If certain groups are overrepresented or underrepresented in the dataset, our conclusions drawn from the analysis may not accurately reflect the general population.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Risk Mitigation:\n",
    "- Clearly documenting the potential limitations and biases in the data and discussing how they might affect the conclusions.\n",
    "- Regularly updating the analysis with new data as it becomes available and monitoring for changes that might suggest previous biases are no longer present or any new biases may have emerged.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset represents only a subset of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Part D.\n",
    "- All of the spending data for a drug that has fewer than 11 claims is redacted.\n",
    "- When the drug information is based on more than 11 claims but less than 11\n",
    "unique beneficiaries, Total Beneficiaries are redacted since that measure uses the\n",
    "unique beneficiary count as its denominator.\n",
    "- The analysis is limited to the data available from 2017 to 2021; does not account\n",
    "for more recent data.\n",
    "- Does not consider the broader context of healthcare policy changes beyond the\n",
    "scope of Medicare Part D.\n",
    "- The Part D spending metrics do not reflect any manufacturers’ rebates or other\n",
    "price concessions as CMS is prohibited from publicly disclosing such information."

    "#### Below we answer the final business questions along with Conclusions for the project as a whole:\n",
    "\n",
    "Actionable Insights\n",
    "1. **High Proportion of Diabetes Medication:**  \n",
    "    - Diabetes medications form a significant part of the Medicare Part D portfolio, about 3.5% of the portfolio is related to diabetes medication, indicating a high prevalence of diabetes among beneficiaries.\n",
    "2. **Outlier Spending on Specific Drugs:**  \n",
    "    - A small number of drugs and manufacturers are responsible for a disproportionately large share of spending, which can be due to a lack of competition or patented formulations.\n",
    "3. **Trend of Increasing Spending:**  \n",
    "    - Overall spending on diabetic medications has been increasing from 2017-2021.\n",
    "4. **Impact of Monopolistic Practices:**\n",
    "    - Certain manufacturers with monopolies over specific drugs tend to increase prices, which contributes to the outlier spending\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations for Stakeholders\n",
    "1. **Negotiation of Drug Prices:**\n",
    "    - We recommend Medicare negotiate directly with drug manufacturers to secure better prices, specifically for high-cost diabetic medications that are outliers in terms of spending cost.\n",
    "2. **Encourage Generic and Biosimilar Drug Use:**\n",
    "    - We recommend Medicare to promote the use of generic and biosimilar versions of expensive diabetic medications to provide a more cost-effective alternative without compromising treatment quality.\n",
    "3. **Implement Price Caps:**\n",
    "    - We recommend setting price caps for essential diabetic medications to prevent price gouging and ensure affordability for Medicare beneficiaries.\n",
    "4. **Supporting Pharmaceutical Competition:**\n",
    "    - We recommend encouraging competition in the pharmaceutical market, in particular for the drugs that are currently monopolized, which will lower prices and increase access to those diabetic medications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing these recommendations, stakeholders can take steps towards optimizing drug spending in the Medicare Part D program, particularly medications concerning diabetes. These actions can lead to more sustainable healthcare spending, improved access to necessary medications for Medicare beneficiaries, and overall better health outcomes for individuals with diabetes."

    "This analysis can be further explored by merging it with an existing dataset on Demographics and Utilization in Medicare. It can be converted to a dashboard, that helps assess the disparities in healthcare accessibibility in regards to Medicare. Moreover, a heatmap over geographical fragments can help in fnding gaps and oppotunities to serve the Medicare population.\n",

    "#### Medicare\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reprodiciblity\n",
    "  - For eg. Use it for analysis of medicaid drug datasets.\n",
    "  - Can use the analysis tool with recent data sets to help improve **real time decisions** made regarding coverage thereby improving healthcare access and cost savings.\n",
    "- Hypothetically can involve adjusting Medicare Part D coverage for diabetic medications based on the analysis and use it to **negotiate prices** with the pharmaceutical companies.\n",
    "- Potential to **integrate with the dashboard** that the CMS maintains.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pharmaeutical Companies\n",
    "\n",
    "- The analysis can also be used by pharmaceutical companies for their future projects and **finding potential areas of research for drugs with limited manufacturers and higher spending**.\n",
    "- **Key-Partnerships** for companies who provide drugs at lower costs in comparison to the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Policmakers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can be used to **inform Medicare policy decisions** related to diabetic medications by the government agencies.\n",
    "- Policy reforms to **cap the costs** for diabetes based medications.\n",
    "- Monitor and manage **provider prescription practices** to foster transition to **Value-Based Care**.\n",
    "- Reforms on current **regulatory barriers that limit generic and biosimilar development**.\n",
    "- Overall improvement of healthcare access and **reduce burden on US healthcare system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Beneficiaries/Patients\n",
    "\n",
    "- Low values, as they have no power over costs, are not the payer.\n",
    "- They can use the interpretation to make informed decisions on pushing policy reforms and bills, election choices as well as selecting insurance plans."

    "#### Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can interpret from the chart that the average spending for the original dataset increases, the average spending for diabetes medications has decreased over time.\n",
    "However, it is still significant considering that **although they just form 3.45% of the all the prescription drugs, the average spending still is 135(2017)-107(2021) percent more than that of the overall average spending**.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Objective 5**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Actionable Insights\n",
    "1. **High Proportion of Diabetes Medication:**  \n",
    "    - Diabetes medications form a significant part of the Medicare Part D portfolio, about 3.5% of the portfolio is related to diabetes medication, indicating a high prevalence of diabetes among beneficiaries.\n",
    "2. **Outlier Spending on Specific Drugs:**  \n",
    "    - A small number of drugs and manufacturers are responsible for a disproportionately large share of spending, which can be due to lack of competition or patented formulations.\n",
    "3. **Trend of Increasing Spending:**  \n",
    "    - Overall spending on diabetic medications has been increasing from 2017-2021.\n",
    "4. **Impact of Monopolistic Practices:**\n",
    "    - Certain manufacturers with monopolies over specific drugs tend to increase prices, which contributes to the outlier spending\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommendations for Stakeholders\n",
    "1. **Negotiation of Drug Prices:**\n",
    "    - We recommend Medicare negotiate directly with drug manufacturers to secure better prices, specifically for high-cost diabetic medications that are outliers in terms of spending cost.\n",
    "2. **Encourage Generic and Biosimilar Drug Use:**\n",
    "    - We recommend Medicare to promote the use of generic and biosimilar versions of expensive diabetic medications to provide a more cost-effective alternative without compromising treatment quality.\n",
    "3. **Implement Price Caps:**\n",
    "    - We recommend setting price caps for essential diabetic medications to prevent price gouging and ensure affordability for Medicare beneficiaries.\n",
    "4. **Supporting Pharmaceutical Competition:**\n",
    "    - We recommend encouraging competition in the pharmaceutical market, in particular for the drugs that are currently monopolized, which will lower prices and increase access to those diabetic medications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "By implementing these recommendations, stakeholders can take steps towards optimizing drug spending in Medicare Part D program, in particularly medications concerning diabetes. These actions can lead to more sustainable healthcare spending, improved access to necessary medications for Medicare beneficiaries, and overall better health outcomes for individuals with diabetes."
